# vdf-parser

`vdf-parser` is a library that can convert VDF to JSON and vice versa.
It is mostly based on [rossengeorgiev/vdf-parser](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev/vdf-parser), but includes some features inspired by [RoyalBingBong/vdfplus](https://github.com/RoyalBingBong/vdfplus) (which lacked some features supported by the former...), and a couple of new features.

VDF may contain comments. However, they are not preserved during decoding.

## Features

- Supports unquoted keys and values
- Supports keys that appear multiple times by "arrayifying" them â€“ whether they contain child objects or other values
- Supports uppercase characters in keys and values (and unquoted floats in values)
- Supports value type recognition and automatic conversion (booleans, integers, floats)
- Supports non well formed objects (missing newlines), for example: `"1" { "label" "#SFUI_WinMatchColon" "value" "#SFUI_Rounds" }`
- Recognizes conditionals (ex. `[$WIN32||$X360]`), but skips their interpretation
- Includes TypeScript types

## Methods

```ts
/**
 * Parse a VDF string into a JavaScript object.
 * @param text VDF text
 * @param types Attempt to automatically convert numbers and booleans to their correct types, defaults to true
 */
export function parse(text: string, types?: boolean = true): object;

/**
 * Parse a JavaScript object into a VDF string
 * @param obj The object to stringify
 * @param pretty Add intendation to the resulting text, defaults to false
 */
export function stringify(obj: object, pretty?: boolean = false): string;
```

## Installation

`npm install vdf-parser`

## Usage

```js
const VDF = require('vdf-parser');
